## Natural Sesame Seeds Product Image

**Issue:** The "Natural Sesame Seeds" product currently uses a placeholder image that is not the actual sesame seeds picture.

**Current Status:** 
- Image path: `assets/img/portfolio/NATURAL SESAME SEEDS.jpeg`
- Currently using a temporary placeholder (copy of pigeon peas image)

**Action Required:**
1. Obtain actual high-quality image of natural sesame seeds
2. Replace the placeholder image at `assets/img/portfolio/NATURAL SESAME SEEDS.jpeg`
3. Ensure image dimensions are approximately 400x300px or similar aspect ratio
4. Image should be optimized for web (ideally under 500KB)

**Recommendation:**
The image should show:
- White/natural colored sesame seeds
- High quality, well-lit photograph
- Clean background
- Professional product photography style to match other product images

**Note:** All other product images are using actual product photos and look professional. The sesame seeds image should match this quality standard.
